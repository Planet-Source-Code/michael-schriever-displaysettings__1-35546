## DisplaySettings


</div>

### Description

This little app enumerates your available display settings and shows the

current display setting of your monitor. That means the xy-resolution,

the colourdepth and the frequency. It also lets you change the current

display setting and is able to call the controlpanel-dialog for

display settings. Please make sure that your monitor suports the

settings to be changed. The app ist developed in VB6 and tested

under W2KSP2. The app is not commented, but I think it is selfexplained.

Be aware of the fact, that changing the resolution could course a

disarrangement of your desktop icons. Choosing a to small xy-resolution

could course, that the Change-Display-Settings-Button is not visible

and you can't restore the orignal resulotion. That's why I placed

this button on top of the form. If you can't get your current resolution

back, start windows in secure-mode (or 'saved mode' I do not know

the English expression, in German 'Abgesicherter Modus') and restore

your display settings.
